# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project



## Assignment instructions



You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.



1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



## Steps to run the script


1. Save the data source onto your hard drive - it will be in a subdirectory named ```UCI HAR Dataset```.

2. Save ```run_analysis.R``` into the same directory as ```UCI HAR Dataset``` and set it as your working directory in RStudio.

3. Run ```source("run_analysis.R")``` and the script will generate ```new_data_set.txt``` in your working directory.
